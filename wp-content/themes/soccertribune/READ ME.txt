2. Go to your WordPress Admin Dashboard > Appearance > Themes and select this theme to activate.
3. Once activated, you're ready to use it.

Theme options
============
To have an images in the slider, you just add a custom field, type slide and leave link to the image. Or check howtoslide.png in themefolder/images/, visual is better :)
If you want to have small thumbnails in mygallery plugin, you have to type thumbnail in custom field and leave link to the image.

But, first of first, you should select sliding category via theme options and number of slides. 

Post thumbnails - how to add images into posts
===============================
This theme supports post thumbnails - it means that images are automatically resized! We encourage you to use this option! 
You also can adjust image size according to your wishes. Just open up index.php, find "the_post_thumbnail(array(250,250), array("class" => "alignleft post_thumbnail")"
and change 250, 250 to whatever you like. If you want images to be aligned right or centered, just change alignleft to alignright or aligncenter and save. 
Classic way of inserting images is still working with this theme, but featured categories option - IS NOT if theme has it! It's set to pull post thumbnails images where images are inserted as thumbnails, not on classic way.

How to insert image as post thumbnail? For example, click on add new post. 
On the bottom right side under categories you'll see a Post thumbnail option, and then click on Set thumbnail.
Upload the image, and then click on Media Library. Click show on image you've just uploaded, and click "Use as thumbnail" option. Thats it!
You dont have to touch anything other (alignment, sizes, nothing!)!
